On the day of your project presentation, you will be asked to hand in a written
report about your project. Your final grade will be determined in equal parts
based on your presentation and your project report. Use visual aides for your
project presentation (e.g. slides, jupyter notebook,...). Your project report
should explain the problem you set out to study and (briefly) the methods you
used. It should document at least central parts of the code and the results.

Don't overdo it: I do not expect you to write the equivalent of a Bachelor's
thesis. Keep things brief, the hard page limit is 10 pages but 4-5 is probably
reasonable.

Evaluation criteria for the project report:

1) Scope and originality: What is the problem that you set out to study? What is
the scope of it? There be at least one original aspect of your work (an algorithm
you implemented (or even developed) yourself, a mathematical analysis of e.g. expected
probability of error or VC dimension, a comparison of different methods,...)

2) Methods and execution: What methods did you use? Is your reasoning for why
you chose your methods and how you use them sound? How did you deal with e.g.
parameters you had to chose? How did you validate your results?

3) Results: Are the results presented in a clear way? If you are doing supervised
learning, you must report the performance of your trained ML method on the test
set or use cross validation. What conclusions can you draw from your results.

Evaluation criteria for the project presentation:

1) Clarity

2) Time management

3) Content (e.g. same criteria as for the report)
